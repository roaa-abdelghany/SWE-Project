## 💡 Project Description
A smart web application that helps users manage their finances efficiently by tracking income, expenses, and budgets.
The system provides an interactive dashboard summarizing monthly transactions, generates visual reports such as pie and bar charts, and alerts users when they exceed their set budgets.
Users can categorize transactions, manage recurring payments, and export detailed reports (PDF or Excel) — all within a secure and user-friendly interface supporting both light and dark modes.
