## 💡 Project Description
The system manager adds a couple of photos and an ID for every employee then the system detect the employee and take a photo of him/her.  
The system then recognizes the employee’s face and add his/her time and date of arrival — also the same thing happens when the employee leaves.  
If any error happened either in the photo’s recognition or the detection the employee enters his/her ID and the manager later accepts it.  
The system manager can see all the information (time and date of arrival and the absence of any employee) also a message would be shown for the employee if he/she is late.
